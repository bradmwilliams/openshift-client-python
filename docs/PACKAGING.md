# Openshift Python Client Packaging

## Introduction
This document primarily serves as a reference for us to publish the openshift-client module to PyPI for general consumption by our consumers.  It can also be used by anyone interested in getting started with Python Packaging as all the documented steps and configurations can easily be migrated to any other package/module.

## Recommended Setup
### Create User Accounts
To work with packaging, you will need to create user accounts on one or both of the following sites:  

#### PyPI - The Python Package Index
For **official** releases that are available for installation
* https://pypi.org/

#### TestPyPI - The Test Python Package Index
For **testing** python packaging without impacting the official index
* https://test.pypi.org/

### Generate API Tokens 
For each account that you create, you can generate API Tokens that make publishing your packages/modules easier.  Once the tokens have been generated, you can add them to your `~/.pypirc` file:

```text
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-<API TOKEN>

[testpypi]
repository: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = pypi-<API TOKEN>
```

## Building
For openshift-client, build both a source distribution and a universal wheel: 
```bash
    python -m build
```
or:
```bash
    make release
```

## Publishing
Publishing to either package index is accomplished by using [Twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).  Because we setup our local `~/.pypirc` above, we can reference the repository by the name defined therein instead of passing the full URL on the commandline.

### TestPyPI
```bash
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
or
```bash
    make publish-testpypi
```

### PyPI
```bash
    twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```
or
```bash
    make publish-pypi:
```

## Installation

### TestPyPI
Installation from TestPyPI must be performed using one of the following methods: 

1. Latest version
```bash
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple openshift-client
```
2. Specific version
```bash
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple openshift-client==1.0.2
```

### PyPI
1. Latest version
```bash
    pip install openshift-client
```

2. Specific version
```bash
    pip install openshift-client==1.0.2
```

## Cleanup
If you're working on changes, you'll need to bump the version string for every publish to either index (releases are unique).  To cleanup the artifacts from previous builds, you can execute the following: 
```bash
    rm -rf dist/ packages/openshift_client.egg-info/ build/
```
